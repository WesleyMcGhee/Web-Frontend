The Internet is a complex web of computers, and servers, that connect people and perform complex algroitims and calculations.  For example if you look 
Theres a super computer that figured out the best design for a Golf Club. An example of how the interenet works is what happens when you click on a link.
This is a simple process that we do everyday yet what happens in the background can be quite a lot.  

Each link that you click on has been set to a certain Domanin Name, that can have End points (where exactly on the page you want to go), Queries,
(Searching something on the website), and Parameters(add more information to endpoint).  Your browser takes that and connects it to a Domain Name Service
(DNS) Which matches the name to the DNS. When you use this an HTTP or HTTPS request gets made to the server bringing back the HTML page, which is the code
that loads the website.  In short this is how the Internet works, it is a vast network of computers and servers makeing request to each other.
