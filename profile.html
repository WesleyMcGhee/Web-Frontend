        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p> I am currently a Student Web Developer, at Devmountain, based out of Minnesota.  Looking to become a Full-stack, or Front-end Developer.
            One of my goals is to become an Operating Systems Engineer, and Start my own Contracting Agency, or Software Company.  Some of my hobbies are,
            Language Learning, Coding, and Cooking.  I am currently Learning Japanese, and hope to travel there one day.  A personal goal I have is to live 
            in a different country for a couple years.  Thank you for reading my bio and have a nice day.
